Part One: Make Game Into a Class
* Create a class called Game
* Create a constructor that possess many instance variables that are part of the game
- This included height and width of the box, players, current players, running the makeBoard () and makeHTMLBoard() to start the game and a instance variable to check if the game is over or not.
* Had to made sure functions worked together by going through all the code and writing "this" on all the variables and functions
* There was one function that gave me problem which was the handleClick(evt) function. What I had to do was make sure I bonded that function to the object. 



Part Two: Small Improvements
*Created a html button, and then use a eventListener on that button to re run "NEW GAME"
*You also make the innerHTML of makeHTMLBoard set to = " " so that when you click the button it restarts as well.
* Made it so you can't pick another item after the game is over by
-removing the event listener on the top row of the game so that there is no action when you click the top row

Part Three: Make Player a Class
